Replica of the Benty Grange helmet at Weston Park Museum in Sheffield The Benty Grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn.[2] It probably weighed about 1.4 kg (3.1 lb), the weight of the Weston Park Museum's 1986 replica.[3] The framework, which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments, originally consisted of seven iron strips, each between 1 and 2 millimetres thick.[2] A brow band, 65 cm (26 in) long and 2.5 cm (1.0 in) wide, encircled the head.[4] Two strips of the same width ran from front to back, and from side to side.[4] The 40 cm (16 in) long nose-to-nape band extended 4.75 cm (1.87 in) in the front and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in the back; the extension over the nose was straight, whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards, so as to fit the nape of the wearer.[4] The lateral band ran from ear to ear; both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band, but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection.[4] It was affixed to the outside of the dexter (wearer's right) side of the brow band, the inside of the sinister (wearer's left) side, and the outside of the nose-to-nape band.[4] The four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron, only one of which now survives.[5] Each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band 7 cm (2.8 in) from the centre of the lateral band.[4] Here they were 22 mm (0.87 in) wide, and, while tapering towards a width of 15 mm (0.59 in), rose at a 70° angle towards the lateral band, which they overlapped at a 50° angle just beneath the crest.[4] The inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth, since decayed.[4][3]

Eight plates of horn, probably softened and bent and suggested to be from cattle,[note 1] were cut to fit the eight spaces created by the iron frame.[10] No horn now survives, but mineralized traces on the iron strips preserve the grain pattern.[4] The plates were fitted over the iron, thereby hiding it, and abutted at the centre of each strip.[11] The joins were hidden by further pieces of horn that were cut to the width of the iron strips and placed on top.[12] The three layers—iron at the bottom, followed by two layers of horn—were held together by a succession of rivets:[12] iron rivets placed from inside the helmet, and rivets made of, or coated in, silver, with ornamental heads in the shape of a double-headed axe, placed from the outside, 4 cm (1.6 in) apart.[12] Traces of horn on the rear extension of the nose-to-nape band, and on the rear brow band, suggest that the material was also used for a neck guard.[12] These suggest that pieces of horn, extending 5 cm (2.0 in) from the centre of the brow band to the bottom of the rear nose-to-nape band, would have met each extension of the lateral band at a 5° angle, reaching them 6.4 cm (2.5 in) from the centre of the brow band.[12]


In addition to the aesthetic elements incorporated into the basic construction of the helmet, two features provide added decoration: a cross on the nasal and a boar on the crest.[13] The silver cross is 3.9 cm (1.5 in) long by 2 cm (0.8 in) wide, and consists of two parts.[14] A silver strip was added underneath, elongating what was originally an equal-armed cross.[14] It was placed atop a layer of horn and attached to the helmet with two rivets, one at the intersection of the two arms and one at the bottom.[15] Around the cross in a zigzag pattern are twenty-nine silver studs, out of a suggested original forty, that were probably tapped into small holes drilled or bored into the horn.[16]



The most distinctive feature of the Benty Grange helmet is its boar, affixed to the apex of the helmet.[17] The core of its body is made of two pieces of hollow D-sectioned bronze tubes, their flat sides approximately 2 mm (0.08 in) apart.[18] The space between the two halves was filled in with a substance, likely horn or metal, which has now disintegrated; it perhaps projected upwards, forming the mane or spine of the boar,[18] or, as has been interpreted on the replica, created a recess into which a mane of actual boar bristles could fit.[19] On either side of the bronze core was affixed a plate of iron, forming the visible exterior of the boar.[20] Four pear-shaped plates of gilded silver—cut down and filed from Roman silver, as evidenced by a classical leaf design on the reverse of the front left plate, and file marks on the obverse—acted as hips, through which passed two silver rivets, one atop the other, per end.[21] These rivets held together the five layers of the boar, and were welded to the plates.[22] Into the body of the boar were placed holes, probably punched, that held circular silver studs approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 in) in diameter.[23] The studs, likely flush with the surface of the body, were filed down and gilded, and may have been intended to represent golden bristles.[23] Eyes were formed with 5 mm (0.20 in) long pointed oval garnets set into gold sockets with filigree wire edging.[24] The sockets were 8 mm (0.31 in) long by 3.5 mm (0.14 in) wide, and had 8 mm (0.31 in) long shanks, filled with beeswax, sunk into the head.[24] Individual pieces of gilded bronze seem to have formed the tail, tusks, muzzle, jawline, and ears of the boar, but few traces of them now remain.[25] Two sets of iron legs—probably solid originally, but rendered hollow by corrosion—attached the body to an elliptical bronze plate; both sets depict front legs, bent forwards without account for the anatomical differences between a boar's fore and hind limbs.[25] The elliptical plate is 9 cm (3.5 in) long with a maximum width of 1.9 cm (0.75 in), and matches the curvature of the helmet.[26] Four holes indicate attachment points for the legs and another three connected the plate to the frame of the helmet, in addition to a large rivet hole slightly behind the centre.[26] The plate was probably affixed directly to the frame, the legs passing through holes in the horn.[27][28]

Function
The Benty Grange helmet would have both offered some protection if worn in battle, and indicated its wearer's status.[3] As the Weston Park replica shows, it would have originally been an impressive object,[29] and may have been intended for ceremonial use.[3] Experiments using a mockup of the replica also showed that the helmet would have resisted blows with an axe, which damaged the horn without entirely breaking it.[3] Arrows and spears pierced the horn, but they also pierced modern fibreglass and safety helmets.[3]
Helmets were rare in Anglo-Saxon England, and the Benty Grange helmet, both by its richness and its scarcity, signified the high status of its owner.[3][29][30] Such protection certainly seems to have been among the armour of the affluent.[31][32] In the contemporary epic Beowulf, a poem about kings and nobles, they are relatively common,[31][32] while the helmeted Vendel and Valsgärde graves from the same period in Sweden, thought to be the burials of wealthy non-royals, suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the absolute élite.[33] Yet thousands of furnished Anglo-Saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the 19th century and helmets remain rare;[34][35][36] this may partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition, but their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers.[36]

Discovery
Colour photograph of the Benty Grange Farm Benty Grange Farm, in the parish of Monyash in the Derbyshire Dales district The helmet was discovered on 3 May 1848 during an excavation on the Benty Grange farm in Derbyshire,[37] in what is now the Peak District National Park.[28] It was found by Thomas Bateman, an archaeologist and antiquarian who was nicknamed "The Barrow Knight" for his excavation of more than 500 barrows.[38][39][40] Bateman described Benty Grange as "a high and bleak situation";[37] its barrow, which still survives, is prominently located by a major Roman road,[41] now the A515, possibly to display the burial to passing travellers.[42] It may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments, Arbor Low stone circle and Gib Hill barrow.[42] According to the 7th- to 9th-century Tribal Hidage, the region was governed by the Pecsæte, and so the Benty Grange barrow may memorialise a member of this Anglo-Saxon tribe,[43][44] or one of its ancestors.[45] The barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately 15 m (50 ft) in diameter and 0.6 m (2 ft) high, an encircling fosse about 1 m (3.3 ft) wide and 0.3 m (1 ft) deep, and outer penannular banks around 3 m (10 ft) wide and 0.2 m (0.66 ft) high.[46] The entire structure measures approximately 23 by 22 m (75 by 72 ft).[46]

Unnoted in Bateman's account is that he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave.[47] The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by 6 ft (1.8 m), and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent, such as a sword and shield, suggests that the grave had previously been looted.[47] Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials, only one of which was discovered by Bateman.[46]

Bateman suggested a body once lay at the centre of the barrow, flat against the original surface of the soil, of which little remained;[37][48] what he described as the one remnant, strands of hair, is now thought to be from a cloak of fur, cowhide or something similar.[49] The recovered objects were found in two clusters.[47][50][51] One cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair, the other about 6 ft (1.8 m) to the west.[50][51] In the former area Bateman described "a curious assemblage of ornaments", which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth.[37][50] This included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood,[52][53] approximately 3 in (7.6 cm) in diameter at the mouth.[37][54] Its rim was edged with silver,[37] while its surface was "decorated by four wheel-shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver, affixed by pins of the same metal, clenched inside".[55] Also found were the remnants of three hanging bowl escutcheons,[54][55][56] as well as "a knot of very fine wire", and some "thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges &c."[55] attached to silk, but that soon decayed when exposed to air.[57]

Approximately 6 ft (1.8 m) to the west of the other objects was found a jumbled mass of ironwork.[58][59][60] Separated, this mass included a collection of chainwork, a six-pronged piece of iron resembling a hayfork, and the helmet.[58][59][60] As Bateman described it:

Colour image of a Llewellynn Jewitt watercolour depicting the Benty Grange helmet and associated finds Watercolour by Llewellynn Jewitt depicting the Benty Grange helmet and associated finds The helmet has been formed of ribs of iron radiating from the crown of the head, and covered with narrow plates of horn, running in a diagonal direction from the ribs, so as to form a herring-bone pattern; the ends were secured by strips of horn, radiating in like manner as the iron ribs, to which they were riveted at intervals of about an inch and a-half: all the rivets had ornamented heads of silver on the outside, and on the front rib is a small cross of the same metal. Upon the top, or crown of the helmet, is an elongated oval brass plate, upon which stands the figure of an animal, carved in iron, now very much rusted, but still a very good representation of a pig: it has bronze eyes. There are also many smaller decorations, abounding in rivets, which have pertained to the helmet, but which it is impossible to assign to their proper places, as is also the case with some small iron buckles.[58]

Bateman closed his 1849 account of the excavation by noting the "particularly corrosive nature of the soil",[61] which by 1861 he said "has generally been the case in tumuli in Derbyshire".[62] He suggested that this was the result of "a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid; the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth, and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains."[62] Bateman's friend Llewellynn Jewitt, an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied Bateman on excavations,[63] painted four watercolours of the finds, parts of which were included in Bateman's 1849 account.[64][note 2] This was more than Jewitt produced for any other of their excavations, a mark of the importance that they assigned to the Benty Grange barrow.[64]

The helmet entered the extensive collection of Bateman, where it attracted interest.[68] On 27 October 1848 he related his discoveries, including the helmet, to the British Archæological Association,[69][70][71] and in 1855 it was catalogued along with other objects from the Benty Grange barrow.[72] In 1861 Bateman died at 39,[40] and in 1876 his son, Thomas W. Bateman, loaned the objects to Sheffield.[73] They were displayed at the Weston Park Museum through 1893, at which time the museum purchased objects, including the helmet, from the family; other pieces were dispersed elsewhere.[74] As of 2018, the helmet remains in the collection of the museum.[75] From 8 November 1991 to 8 March 1992 it joined the Coppergate helmet at the British Museum for The Making of England: Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture, AD 600–900.[76][77]

The Benty Grange barrow was designated a scheduled monument on 23 October 1970.[46] The list entry notes that "[a]lthough the centre of Benty Grange [barrow] has been partially disturbed by excavation, the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains."[46] It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information.[46] The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014;[78][79] as of 2018 it is rented out as a holiday cottage.[80]

Conservation
In 1948, the helmet was brought to the British Museum to undergo cleaning and study.[81] Permission to carry out the work had been requested the previous year,[82] when Rupert Bruce-Mitford, recently returned from World War II service in the Royal Signals to an assistant keepership at the museum,[83] spent time in Sheffield examining the Benty Grange grave goods.[47] A 1940 letter from T. D. Kendrick to Bruce-Mitford's army camp had assigned him his position, and responsibility for the Sutton Hoo discoveries—"Brace yourself for the task", the letter concluded.[84] Upon his return, he therefore took to studying the comparison material; his work in 1947 included the excavation of the Valsgärde 11 boat-grave in Sweden alongside Sune Lindqvist,[85][86] and the trip to Sheffield, intended to shed light on the Sutton Hoo helmet through comparison with the only other Anglo-Saxon helmet then known.[47] Permission was obtained from the curator and trustees of the Weston Park Museum for the proposed work, and, in April 1948, a century and a month after its discovery, the Benty Grange helmet was brought to London.[81]

Work at the British Museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory Harold Plenderleith, who in some cases, particularly with the boar, did the work himself; additional input was provided by Bruce-Mitford, the technical attaché and authority on ancient metalwork Herbert Maryon, and the archaeologist and art historian Françoise Henry.[87] In the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode, and certain parts had become indiscernible.[75] The boar was unrecognizable, and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured.[88] A strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation, revealing the underlying features.[89] During this process, the boar, hitherto thought solid, snapped in two.[89] Bruce-Mitford termed this occurrence "fortunate", for it revealed the boar's inner structure.[89] Frederic Charles Fraser examined the remnants of horn at the Natural History Museum, and conducted experiments softening and shaping modern horn.[6]
